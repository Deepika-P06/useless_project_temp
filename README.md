)
This CSS creates a clean sky background with animated floating clouds and birds. It styles clickable word bubbles that show meanings in a popup, combining smooth animations with a user-friendly, visually appealing design.

This script creates animated floating words and birds in the sky. Clicking a word shows a funny fake meaning in a popup, making the page interactive and lively.


# Diagrams
![Workflow](![flowchart(skyvault) 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe5b84c-ef69-487a-81b3-23e38f14bf77)
)
This flowchart describes the process of handling a word input for displaying its opposite meaning. It starts by taking a word input, then checks if the word is selected. If not selected, it does nothing and stops. If selected, it continues and displays the opposite meaning of the word before stopping. This represents a simple decision flow for showing a fake antonym based on user interaction.
